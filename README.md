# mybots

mybots is a project I built for my Evolutionary Robotics class I had with Dr. Josh Bongard.

We built a system of neurons and synapses designed to simulate a neural network of a modular design.
We also built virtual robots of varying complexity in a physics engine and interfaced our neural networks with them.
We used evolutionary algorithms and fitness functions to evolve the robots' neural controllers towards performing various 
tasks in the physics engine.
